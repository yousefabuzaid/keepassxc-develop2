== Password Generator
This password generator helps you to generate random strong passwords and passphrases that you can use for your applications and websites you visit.

=== Generating Passwords
To generate random passwords, specify the characters to be used in your choice of password (for example, upper-case letters, digits, special characters, and so on) and KeePassXC will randomly pick characters out of the set.

To generate the random password using Password Generator, perform the following steps:

1. Open KeePassXC.
2. Navigate to Tools > Password Generator. The following screen appears:

4. Select the character-sets that you want to include in your password.
5. Use the regenerate button (Ctrl + R) to make a new password using the chosen options.
6. Use the clipboard button (Ctrl + C) to copy the generated password to the clipboard.

=== Generating Passphrases
A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to your applications and data. A passphrase is specifically designed to be simple to remember but hard to guess. For this reason, we do not recommend making passphrases too complex; if you require something that is more complex than you could easily remember, it is better to use a randomly generated password instead.

1. From the password generator, click the Passphrase tab. The following screen appears:
+
.Passphrase Generator

2. Select the number of words you want to be included in your passphrase by dragging the
Word Count slider.
3. In the Word Separator field, enter a character, word, number, or space that you want to use as a separator between the words in your passphrase.
4. _(Optional)_ You can choose a word case between lower, upper, and title case options.
5. _(Optional)_ You can also load your own custom word lists. Click the plus sign button to the right of the wordlist selection dialog to choose a custom word list. You can download alternative lists from the https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases[EFF's Website] or from https://github.com/redacted/XKCD-password-generator#additional-languages[GitHub].
6. Click the Regenerate button (Ctrl + R) to generate a new random passphrase.
7. Click the Clipboard button (Ctrl + C) to copy the passphrase to the clipboard.
