The KeePassXC-Browser extension is available on the following web browsers:

* Google Chrome, Vivaldi, and Brave
* Mozilla Firefox and Tor-Browser
* Microsoft Edge
* Chromium

=== Browser statistics
You can see a cross-section of all browser-related settings applied to entries within a database through the Browser Statistics report. To access these, use the _Database_ -> _Database reports..._ menu option then click on _Browser Statistics_ on the left-hand menu. From here you can see all entries with URLs applied to them, explicitly allowed and denied URLs, and any entries with custom browser settings.

.Browser statistics

=== Advanced Usage
You can configure unique browser integration behavior for each entry. This allows you to add multiple URLs to an entry, hide an entry from the browser integration, and more. To access these settings, open an entry for editing then click on _Browser Integration_ option in the left-hand menu *(1)*.

After opening the settings you can add any number of additional URLs by clicking the _Add_ button *(2)* and typing the URL in the list to the left *(3)*.

.Entry browser settings

To set options for all entries within a group, edit the group and go to the browser integration section *(1)*. Here you can explicitly disable access to all entries under a group hierarchy to the browser extension. You can set other useful options for groups of entries as well.

.Group browser settings

Database-wide operations are available in the database settings. To access these use the _Database_ -> _Database settings..._ menu option. Click on _Browser Integration_ on the left-hand menu. From here you can disconnect all browsers, convert legacy KeePass-HTTP settings, reset all entry-level settings, and refresh the database root group ID (useful when making copies of your database file).

Finally, advanced application-wide settings are available in the Browser Integration tab of the application settings.

WARNING: We do not recommend changing any of these settings as they may break the browser integration plugin.
