Before installing KeePassXC, it is recommended that you verify that your downloaded installer matches the signature, which is published alongside the release package. By verifying the signatures of KeePassXC releases, you can verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded installation file. This guarantees that the file you downloaded was originally created by the KeePassXC Team and its contents have not been tampered with.

The Snap and Flatpak options are sandboxed applications (more secure). The Native option is installed with the operating system files. Read more about the limitations of these options here: https://keepassxc.org/docs/#faq-appsnap-yubikey[KeePassXC Snap FAQ]
