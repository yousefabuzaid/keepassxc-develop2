== Welcome
KeePassXC is a modern, secure, and open-source password manager that stores and manages your most sensitive information. You can run KeePassXC on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

KeePassXC is for people with extremely high demands of secure personal data management. It saves many different types of information, such as usernames, passwords, URLs, attachments, and notes in an offline, encrypted file that can be stored in any location, including private and public cloud solutions. For easy identification and management, user-defined titles and icons can be specified for entries. In addition, entries are sorted in customizable groups. An integrated search function allows you to use advanced patterns to easily find any entry in your database. A customizable, fast, and easy-to-use password generator utility allows you to create passwords with any combination of characters or easy to remember passphrases.

=== Overview
You can store an unlimited number of passwords and information in a KeePassXC database. Every piece of information you store in your database is encrypted at all times within the `kdbx` file. When you are accessing your database from within KeePassXC, your information is decrypted and stored in your computer's memory. KeePassXC places controls over the access to this data so other applications cannot read it (unless they have administrative rights). The interface is designed to let you quickly access your passwords, search for the right entry, perform Auto-Type or copy/paste operations, make and save changes, and then get out of your way.

KeePassXC ships with light and dark themes specifically designed to meet accessibility standards. In most cases, the appropriate theme for your system will be determined automatically, but you can always set a specific theme in the application settings.
